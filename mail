Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope you are well. I wanted to sincerely thank you for your time and support in providing my recommendation letter. Your help truly meant a lot to me.

I am writing to share an update regarding my PhD application. I was admitted to the Computer Science PhD program at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. Initially, I was offered funding, but since it fell under the U.S. Department of Energy regulations, it was later confirmed that the funding is restricted to U.S. citizens only.

Following this, the department asked me to search for another lab. Due to the limited time available for Spring 2025, I was unable to secure a new placement. Just yesterday, they informed me that I may need to defer my admission to Fall 2026 when funding might become available.

Despite the challenges, I wanted to express my gratitude to you once again for your guidance, support, and the trust you placed in me. It has been invaluable throughout this process.

Thank you very much, Professor.

Warm regards,
Shoaib Ahmad
